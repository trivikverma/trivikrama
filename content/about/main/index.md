  Recently, I have been developing or changing course material to incorporate and respect diversity, experiences and critical thinking. My goal is to transform university education to reflect learning, empower minorities and shape a healthy and sustainable research culture. We just got awarded a HORIZON grant for Democratizing Just Energy Transitions (DUST) and a TU Delft fund for building open-source participatory tools Called CITIZEN VOICE! Both are led by wonderful colleagues.
