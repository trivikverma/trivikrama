  Hello! Welcome.

I am a Professor of Just Urban Futures at Loughborough University, UK. My research focusses on cities, inequalities, and justice. I study various challenges of urbanisation such as segregation, inequities in access and wellbeing, transport and energy poverty, and climate-related vulnerabilities. Although I am trained in computational methods like quantitative human geography, I am agnostic to the them and focus more on evidence-based research, particpatory planning, and public engagement to identify pathways for just urban futures.

I also instruct on remote expeditions for National Geographic and Smithsonian where high school students have the opportunity to learn about conservation, anthropology, engineering and policy. Previously, I helped build a media and technology startup dedicated to the cause of making this planet a healthier place through authentic journalism and data science at The Outdoor Journal.
