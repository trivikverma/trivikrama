  Hello! Welcome.

My research focusses on tackling challenges of urbanisation in an equitable and just manner. I am particularly interested in understanding the processes that drive and shape urbanization and reproduce inequalities. I focus on using methods in spatial data science, complex network analyses and participatory mapping to develop computational and mixed methods for advancing the theories and practices of urban science. 

I also instruct on remote expeditions for National Geographic where high school students have the opportunity to learn about conservation, anthropology, engineering and policy. Previously, I helped build a media and technology startup dedicated to the cause of making this planet a healthier place through authentic journalism and data science at The Outdoor Journal.
